# FizzBuzz Game

This is a simple implementation of the FizzBuzz game in Python. The game prints numbers from 1 to `n`, but for multiples of 3, it prints "Fizz" instead of the number, for multiples of 5, it prints "Buzz", and for multiples of both 3 and 5, it prints "FizzBuzz".

## How to Play

1. The game will prompt you to enter a number `n`.
2. The game will then print numbers from 1 to `n` with the following rules:
   - For multiples of 3, print "Fizz".
   - For multiples of 5, print "Buzz".
   - For multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".
   - For all other numbers, print the number itself.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the `FizzBuzz.py` file.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the `FizzBuzz.py` file.
